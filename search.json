Abu Salih, a political science researcher with a focus on comparative politics, particularly democracy and democratization, especially in the context of the Middle East region.\nI hold a Master’s degree in Political Science and International Relations, which has provided me with a solid foundation to understand and analyze complex political issues.\nMy master’s thesis examines the impact of the initial successes of the Arab Spring movements (Tunisia, Egypt and Libya) on the Syrian democratic movement, showing that Syria’s emulation of these movements contributed to its failure and shedding light on the challenges of initiating such movements in simultaneous contexts.\nI am committed to engaging in more puzzles, conducting rigorous research, and sharing ideas in the field, with the aim of contributing to our collective knowledge to strengthen democracy around the world.\n\n\nInterests\n\nComparative Politics\nDemocracy and Democratization\nMiddle East Politics\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\nM.A., Political Science and International Relations, 2022 Altınbaş University, Istanbul"
